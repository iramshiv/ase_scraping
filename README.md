### Introduction
This is a web scraping project, scrapping stepstones.de using python and beautiful soup. This scraps only for jobs posted newer than 24 hours or seven days, which can be chose by user.

Run *scraper.py* for the initiating the scrapper.

### Metrics
**Sonarcube**

**Codacy**


### Clean Code Development

**Naming Rules**
1. Descriptive and Intention revealing variable names.
2. Pronounceable and Searchablr names.

**Data Structures**
3. Data Structure exposes data and have no behaviours.

**Objects**
4. Objects expose behaviour and exposes no data.

**Functions**
5. Function should be small and concentrate on only one job.
6. Functions should have few arguments. (<3)
7. Function should have no side effects.
8. Fucntions should also have decriptive names.

**Tests**
9. Only one assert per test.
10. Should be as clean as production code.
11. should be easy to run.

**Error Handling**
12. Never mix erro handling and the code.
13. use exceptions instead of returning error codes.
14. first code "try catch finally" -> Structured code.
15. Always throws exceptions with constants.

### Build Management

*pybuilder* has been used as build management tool.
https://pybuilder.github.io/

Commands:

```sudo apt-get install pybuilder```

Inside the project directory:

```pyb --start-project```

for pychram Ide integration: 

add ```use_plugin('python.pycharm')``` in build.py
run ```pyb pycharm_generate```

These are the basic initiation commands.
build.py file is as below.

### IDE
PyCharm shortcuts

1. double ```shift``` -  search
2. ```alt + enter``` - Show intention actions and quick-fixes
3. ```F2``` - Navigate between code issues
4.```shift + F2``` - Jump to the next or previous highlighted error.
5. ```ctrl + /``` - line comment
6. ```shift + F10``` - run current file
7. ```shift + F9``` - debug current file
8. ```ctrl + f8``` - toogle line breakpoint
9. ```ctrl + alt + shift + f8``` - toogle temporary line breakpoint
10. ```ctrl + shift + f8``` - View Breakpoint

### Functional Programming

1. Final Data structure:

In src/main/userfunctions/job_scraper.py

Dict is used as below code,

```jobs = {} ```
```title_job = job_title.text```
```jobs[title_job] = {}```
    
 ```company_job = company_name.text```
 ```jobs[title_job]['company'] = company_job```
    
```posted_time_job = time_posted.get_text()```
```jobs[title_job]['time_posted'] = posted_time_job```
   
```final_link = "https://www.stepstone.de" + job_link.attrs['href']```
```jobs[title_job]['job_link'] = final_link```
